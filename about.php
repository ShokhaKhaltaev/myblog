	<p>Welcome to <span class="indigo-text"> YAKO@blogs!</span> I am really glad to see you here. I hope that you will find my blog and first project interesting and useful for people. What is the purpose of this web-site? So, my blog was created to share some interesting facts with people and to help them to broaden their horizons. First of all, just test everything in this website to understand the functionality of YAKO@blogs and then you can actually post some content. The content should contain Title and Description and Blog but also the image which is optional to make it colorful and fascinating. Blog without an image? Hmmm... boring right? So, therefore I recommend you to uplaod an image and see how fascination it looks in our page <span class="indigo-text">YAKO@Blogs.</span>
	If you find any bags or some problems with functionality, please let us know about it. Our community will try to fix it and make our blog more understanble and cool!
	Lets make YAKO@blogs better day by day!<span class="red-text"> Together we can do it!!!</span></p>
